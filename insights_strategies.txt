#STRATEGIES

Strategy Idea 1
Sentiment-Adaptive Risk Scaling

Rule of Thumb:
Increase position size during Extreme Greed; reduce position size during Extreme Fear.

Why?
From our data:
Win rate increases from 37.1% (Extreme Fear) to 46.5% (Extreme Greed),that’s a ~9.4 percentage point improvement
Performance is materially stronger in strong bullish sentiment

Practical Implementation:

Sentiment	    Position Rule
Extreme Greed	Increase size by 20–30%
Greed	        Normal size
Neutral	        Normal size
Fear	        Reduce size by 15–20%
Extreme Fear	Reduce size by 30–40%

Rationale:
Traders perform better during strong bullish sentiment
Extreme Fear increases downside risk and lowers win probability
Scaling exposure based on sentiment improves risk-adjusted returns

Strategy Idea 2
Selective Aggression by Trader Type

Rule of Thumb:
Frequent and Consistent traders should trade actively during Greed phases; Infrequent or Volatile traders should reduce activity during Fear phases.

Why?
our segmentation showed:
Frequent traders adapt better to bullish cycles
Volatile traders experience amplified drawdowns during Fear
Behavioral sensitivity differs across segments

Practical Implementation:

For Frequent Traders:
Increase trade frequency during Greed
Maintain normal exposure in Neutral
Slightly reduce during Extreme Fear
For Volatile Traders:
cut exposure aggressively during Fear
Avoid overtrading during high volatility sentiment

Rationale:

Not all traders react equally to sentiment shifts.
